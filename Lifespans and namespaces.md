Short markdown to write my thoughts on lifespans and namespaces within the project.
There will be components repeated many times throughout this project: ion channels, synapses, or calcium dynamics and pins. The lifespan of each of these will be done as bio-realistically as possible; an ion channel is nothing without a neuron membrane to hold it, which is nothing without a neuron. Therefore subcomponents of larger components will always be compartmentalized to their supercomponent. Exceptions to this include synapses, which will live at the network level, and other similar components.

0704, struggling with single Ca-HHNeuron *sad*.
